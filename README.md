# UNIBOT
This is a student developed self-driving self-balancing unicycle, controlled with lidar navigation.


# TODO
- write code to detect if robot is vertical or not, then send brake signal
- fix get angle position implementation
- figure out quadrature encoding to create wheel speed function
- print out new side plate with elongated screw slots. The main motor belt needs more tension.
- print out a new top plate with hole cutouts for the raspberry pi 5
- find a remote controller that I could use to control everything.
- add screws to the reaction wheel's to increase mass.
